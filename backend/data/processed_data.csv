The interface allows the AI access to most of the suit's internal systems, though the Spartan has override control. The AI is capable of significantly improving the data transfer rate between the motor cortex of the Spartan and the MJOLNIR's processing unit, further improving the Spartan's already lightning-quick reaction time.

When the Zoetrope spins clockwise, the mind of a person viewing the moving picture imprints into the Zoetrope. A second person can then view the imprint by touching the Zoetrope, or reverse the process by spinning it counter-clockwise. If the Zoetrope is physically attached to an adequate vessel, it will dump the user's mind into it instead of just imprinting. Hugo Miller used the zoetrope when he built the ""AI"" for Warehouse 13. He hooked the zoetrope up to the computer system and attempted to imprint himself on the computer. He only partially succeeded, in that the left half of his brain made the transfer, leaving only the right in his body. The Warehouse agents reversed the process, reintegrating the physical Hugo with the virtual Hugo. Real-world connections

It transmits the mindset of Lucrezia Borgia via the crystals and ionized metal of the comb and grants the user mind controlling abilities, though at the price of great personal jealousy and anger. The comb also uses a phonetic trigger written in Italian: Se li uomini sapessino le cagioni della paura mia, capir potrebbero il mio dolor (which translates to: if people knew the reasons for my fear, they'd be able to understand my pain). This comb comes with a book-shaped jewellery box, within which the phonetic trigger can be found. Whoever the comb takes control of, it makes that person have a deep yearning to be loved, just like Lucrezia had. However, the wearer will do anything to obtain love, and usually begins a bloody reign of terror and destruction. The comb also has mind control powers; when the user reads the trigger aloud, the comb releases a bright light that alters the brain chemistry of anybody that sees it and essentially brainwashes them. The indicator that a person is brainwashed is that they keep repeating the trigger. The wearer will have a hole in their heart that will be filled after everybody everywhere is in love with them or is dead.

The creatures are referred to as “roaches” in the episode, but they’re actually people who are victims of a genocidal campaign to “keep the human bloodline pure.” The MASS also suppresses the user’s sense of smell in the episode in order to make them less responsive to the smells of death they encounter.

It is utilized by the Ghost Program, begun when the shortcomings of the psychic dampener became apparent in the wake of Sarah Kerrigan's defection in 2491. As such, memory wipes became standard operating procedure, allowing for more permanent control of its ghost agents, along with helping conceal information. Memory wipes ceased to be mandatory for ghost agents after Valerian Mengsk came to power.
The memory assignment protocol is run by an electrical device based in a neuro-lab which nullifies the use of psychic powers. In 2501, it was generally operated by Superintendent Sarco Angelini, himself a ghost.

In addition to long-term wipes, a wipe can be used to erase memories from a specific span of time. The device wouldn't be used on a severely injured ghost, however. Some residual memories may reside in the subject after a memory wipe, which can possibly influence their personality on the sub-conscious level.
Terrazine can reverse the effects of a memory wipe through its rejuvenation of a telepath's brain cells. In addition, some forms of psychic trauma, such as that inflicted on Gabriel Tosh, also render memory wipes ineffective.

89,StarCraft,1998,"Neural inhibitors (also known as neuro-adjusters or psychic dampeners) are cybernetic implants that were used by the Confederate Ghost Program (and later, the Dominion) to control their ghost agents through keeping their aggression levels and behavioral patterns in check. These devices weaken their psionic powers, and by extension, make it easier for ghosts to screen out the thoughts of other individuals. Implanted in the brain, neural inhibitors can regulate brain and blood chemistry and reroute neural pathways in order to keep the ghost's emotional state in check. The implants can be fatal and their method of operation is very similar to neural resocialization, but ""much worse"".
The location of neural inhibitors can be tracked by some officers, both Confederate and Dominion.The implantation process leaves scarred tissue.
The drawback to neural inhibitors is that they can be surgically removed, or in rare cases, malfunction. Upon the defection of Sarah Kerrigan, psychic dampeners were abandoned by the Confederacy in favor of the more effective memory wipe technique. However, previously-implanted ghosts (such as Devon Starke) usually did not have their dampeners removed. Ghosts who retained them that became spectres under Project Shadow Blade had their inhibitors removed in order to avoid detection. Some ghosts have used their psionic powers to disable their inhibitors, though such a procedure comes at a great risk.

Most of the users have been quite upset with Dunn, directly blaming him for their mental deterioration. He also finds out that Dunn and his wife Carolyn (Julia Ormond) were separated after they lost their only daughter in an accident. After a confrontation with one of his patients, Dunn realized how much pain his machine caused people and attempted to use it to erase his own painful memories. However, doing so resulted in his death when the machine sent him into synaptic failure.
Bloom re-watches his “accident memory” and finds out that the Dunns were in the other car and that their daughter was killed in the collision. Bloom had fled the scene after seeing the little girl dead, leaving his brother to take the fall. Bloom hands over his memory to Carolyn as a sort of confession apology.

Although Dr. Nayaks motivations aren't completely clear, he apparently is using his device to both experience their dreams and induce hallucinations in his victims at the same time. While not directly mind control, the induced hallucinations can trigger behaviors beyond the conscious control of the victim.

147,Futurama,2000,"Brain Slugs are a species of space parasite that attaches its jelly-like body to a person's head and takes control of their brain. The specimen is green in color and consists of a translucent jelly-like body complete with two feelers and one large eyeball. An adult brain slug is about the size of a fist. A person who has been possessed by a brain slug is most likely to adopt a monotone voice and will do everything in its power to aid the spreading of the brain slug population across the universe. The easiest way to tell if someone is infected is the Brain Slug mass which sits atop of their head. Although the Brain Slug is in control of the host, the human is still aware of itself and the parasite's presence, which Hermes referred to as a 'nightmare'.

149,X-Men,1964,"Cerebro amplifies the brainwaves of the user. In the case of telepaths, it enables the user to detect traces of others worldwide, also able to distinguish between humans and mutants. Depictions of its inherent strength have been inconsistent; at times in the storylines it could detect mutated aliens outside of the planet, when at others it could only scan for mutants' signatures in the United States. It is not clear whether it finds mutants by the power signature they send out when they use their powers or by the presence of the X-gene in their body; both methods have been used throughout the comics.
Using Cerebro can be extremely dangerous, and telepaths without well-trained, disciplined minds put themselves at great risk when attempting to use it. This is due to the psychic feedback that users experience when operating Cerebro. As the device greatly enhances natural psychic ability, users who are unprepared for the sheer enormity of this increased psychic input can be quickly and easily overwhelmed, resulting in insanity, coma, permanent brain damage or even death. The one exception has been Magneto, who has been said to have minor or latent telepathic abilities as well as experience amplifying his mental powers with mechanical devices of his own design. Some mutants have learned to shield themselves from Cerebro, usually via their own telepathic ability. Magneto can shield himself from the device through use of minimal telepathic powers; in the film series, he does so with a specially constructed helmet. Originally, Cerebro was a device similar to a computer that was built into a desk in Xavier's office. This early version of Cerebro operated on punched cards, and did not require a user (telepathic or otherwise) to interface with it. A prototype version of Cerebro named Cyberno was used by Xavier to track down Cyclops in the ""Origins of the X-Men"" back-up story in X-Men Volume 1 #40. In the first published appearance of Cerebro, X-Men Volume 1 #7, Professor X left the X-Men on a secret mission (to find Lucifer) and left Cerebro to the new team leader, Cyclops, who used it to keep track of known evil mutants and to find new evil mutants. The device also warned the X-Men of the impending threat posed by the non-mutant Juggernaut prior to that character's first appearance. Later, the device was upgraded to the larger and more familiar telepathy-based technology with its interface helmet. More recently, following the example set by the X-Men films, Cerebro has been replaced by Cerebra (referred to as Cerebro's big sister), a machine the size of a small room in the basement of Xavier's School For Higher Learning. Though designed to resemble the movie version of Cerebro, Cerebra is much smaller than the films' version. It resembles a pod filled with a sparkling fog that condenses into representations of mental images.",helmet,"manipulation, reading thoughts, telepathy","Movie, comics, game",N/A,1964,2171,208,0.27884615,0.28019324,0.15808541,0,0.25,"Jack Kirby, Stan Lee",20th Century Fox,"20th Century Fox, Marvel Studios"

Anything said to the patient while he was in this state would become his own thoughts.

156,Avatar,2009,"Avatar Control Link, Bed Unit, Link Unit. An avatar driver uses a whole-body remote neural interface to control and animate the avatar body. These link units are located in a dedicated facility, such as that installed at the Hell's Gate base on Pandora. The link beds outwardly resemble MRI scanners, with the operator reclining inside an enclosed capsule. The capsule incorporates neural collection and feedback loops for control transmission and reception of sensory information from the avatar body. The link capsule also continuously monitors operator vital signs and avatar operational parameters. In the event of an abnormality, the link is discontinued immediately or referred to a BioLab technician for further analysis.
To initiate the link, the operator clears his or her mind and enters a transit state of consciousness while the link is established. Once operator-avatar connection quality stabilizes above 99%, the link is set to active; the operator then immediately 'wakes up' inside the avatar body. The operator's own neurotransmitters then cause atonia, disconnecting the operator's natural body from the movements played out by the avatar. Continuous link times vary by individual operator; a new operator may tire and prematurely disconnect from the avatar after only a few minutes, while an experienced driver is capable of several hours or even days link time. Upon disconnection, either by emergency fail-safe or the operator's conscious command, the avatar reverts to a static sleep state, while the operator's consciousness is awakened safely in his or her own body. Disorientation is common upon return, although experience reduces downtime. Emergency disconnections are dangerous, potentially resulting in shock to the human operator and damage to the avatar itself. Catastrophic damage to the avatar, resulting in its biological death, has the same effect.
Avatar operations are limited by the need for the human operator to sleep, rest, and eat. Similarly, the avatar body must be maintained through periods of activity alternating with sleep/disconnection time as well as by consumption of fluids and foodstuffs.
The link machinery is small enough to allow for field operation where link transmission range may become an issue. Compact field bases feature a bank of three ruggedized link beds. Basic science/accommodation facilities are included with embedded power and air filtration, making them fully self-sufficient for short sorties into the Pandoran jungle. The field base can be air-lifted using a Samson air transport to reach remote locations. Although occasionally prone to 'glitches', transmission strength is strong enough to ensure link integrity even in extreme environments such as the flux vortices found in the Hallelujah Mountains of Pandora.

169,The Matrix,1999,"A headjack is the small data port created on synthetically-grown humans who become connected to the neural-interactive virtual reality known as the Matrix. The headjacks were located at the base of the skull, just above where the neck meets the back of the head. Approximately 1 inch (2.54 cm) in diameter, it provided room within the otherwise close quarters of the human cranium for a data probe approximately 8 inches (20 cm) in length and 0.79 inches (2 cm) in diameter. These were installed during the synthetic humans' fetal stages and altogether redirected the brain's signals into any data probe plugged into the headjack. The headjack was the interface used to primarily connect to the Matrix. More than just connecting to the Matrix, however, the headjack was also used by redpills to connect to any compatible simulated reality like the Construct. Once a redpill was connected to either the Matrix or the Construct, the headjack could then be used to upload data directly into the human brain. This was used by the Resistance to great effect, uploading instructional information to support agents during training and even during mission proper. Some examples of the upload-able information used by the operatives were gun handling, a range of self defense and martial arts techniques, and helicopter piloting.
The manner by which the headjack and data probe worked had not been sufficiently described.

222,The Night's Dawn Trilogy,1996,"Neural nanonics are a form of nanoscale technology implanted at the base of the skull that serve as a highly advanced computer system directly linked to the subject's brain. Neural nanonic sets are available in a variety of models which vary in power and applications, like modern computers. Neural nanonics range from very basic models, designed for the average person which allows the day-to-day functions of a neural-linked information culture, to incredibly complex and powerful sets which can allow a user to fly starships (or fly them automatically, to a lesser degree) or command battalions of men. Functioning nanonics have no undesired control over the brain, preserving the will and privacy of the user. However, programmes can be set to ""primary"" mode, at which point they can aide the user, or take control of certain bodily functions completely. Applications:
§ Datavises: E-mail type communication with people and machinery. Control over equipment occurs with thought alone.
§ Sensevises: A way of communicating and viewing data. An image alone with sound , smell, texture, taste etc is electronically encoded directly into the brain. This allows a close approximation to the Edenist affinitygene on a technological level. It provides full stimulation, and complete immersion in a fantasy world. Secure (Level 1) sensevises can occur which are said to be unbreakable by human technological standards.
§ Neuroiconic-Display: Displays data ""into your mind"", the data is viewed through your eyes in your peripheral vision, everything from the time, to datavise answers, through to starship controls and readouts can appear. The information can be expanded on through thought, at which point the display will give greater detail, or activate/answer/respond to, the message/program etc. Damage to the host body (physiological monitors) or starship, etc, are overlaid as icons on a outline of the object in question.
§ Enhanced memory retrieval: Memories can be ""sorted"" and ""filed"" as well as played back and backed up.
§ Physiological and Biochemical Control Functions: Nanonics allow a user to access their body's chemical and physical functions for the purposes of medical diagnosis and treatment--nanonics improve the speed and effectiveness of medical nanonic packages for instance. On a lighter note, neural nanonics allow a person to minimize the effects of their body's unwanted physiological functions, including dampening the effects of alcohol and sexual arousal.
§ Axon Blocks: Axon blocks can block any form of pain from the body, allowing the user to continue to function even with severe wounds. They can also block nausea, and bodily functions, for a while at least.
§ Stimulant Programs: “Stim” programs as they are known range from increasing adrenalin production in times of danger, to flooding the body with endorphins, the higher range programs are considered black market, as they very closely replicate the effect of drugs, with many of the same side effects.
§ Somnolence Progams: Force the user to sleep
§ Attack/Defence: Programs analyse attacks of enemies and can give counter moves, in primary mode many even perform the moves on behalf of the user. This can also “spot” dangers which a normal human may miss.
§ Other uses: Automatic weapon control, Encyclopedia Galactica, SII Suit control, linguistic translation, news informats, starship astrogation, net searches, sight amplification, hearing amplification, full range nerve overrides for the entire body, implant command, total indexed memory recall, electronic warfare.",implant,"communication, linking, memory, robot/object control, stimulation",Novel,military,1996,2121,126,0.20634921,0.14857143,0.11267572,1,0.75,Peter F.

232,The Night's Dawn Trilogy,1996,"Affinity is a quasi-telepathic link that was developed by the Edenists in the late 21st Century. They use it to communicate mentally with each other, with their habitats and voidhawks. By the 27th Century, it has been further developed to allow direct control of non-sentient computers (such as a bitek array) and animal life forms (such as spiders for remote sensing).
Originally, affinity was achieved by neuron symbionts. That is, an implant in the brains of the ""sender"" and ""receiver"", allowing them to contact each other. Eventually, affinity was encoded in human DNA and embryos engineered to carry this gene. This was one of the reasons which caused the Edenist community to be ex-communicated from the Church (the other being the transfer of Edenist memories and personalities to the neural strata of the original habitat Eden).
Affinity has two modes of communication. One is a secure person-to-person mode for privacy, the other is communial, allowing all Edenists in a given location to pick up on the conversation. Taking the communial mode further, Edenists have a ""Consensus"", kind of mega-meeting of minds, to discuss matters of grave concern (i.e possesion or the Laton crisis).
One of the misconceptions of affinity that Adamists often have is that affinity is ""a voice inside your head"". It is so much more, as a full range of emotions, visual images, smells, and sounds can be transmitted.
Affinity works using an odd property of physics known as quantum entanglement. When two particles are entangled in such a way, the two are linked at a fundamental level, no matter how far apart they are. This allows affinity to broadcast data etc without any apparent means of transmission (i.e. radio), which renders the link to be undetectable of non-affinity technology. It also allows faster-than-light communication. In reality, the distance that affinity has is limited by the power of the sender and the interference present such as large quantities of matter.
Affinity is not used exclusively by Edenists. Owners of blackhawk starships (who are usually Adamist) will have neuron symbionts implanted which allows affinity communication with their ship. Unlike Edenist affinity, the owners link is ""tuned in"" to ship only. Blackhawks do have general affinity though.",implant,"communication, linking, telepathy",Novel,"group mind, religion",1996,2121,126,0.20634921,0.14857143,0.11267572,1,0.75,Peter F. Hamilton,N/A,N/A

When first depicted in the TOS episode ""Dagger of the Mind"", the procedure was said to require several moments of intense concentration and preparation. However, subsequent episodes show contact between minds occurring almost immediately. Although most often seen done with humanoids, mind melds can be performed with members of other species. Spock even once successfully mind melded with a machine and was able to establish telepathic contact with the mechanical probe V'ger. 
Mind melds can be used both to erase and restore memories; Spock performs each of these on Captain Kirk during TOS 's third season. A mind meld was even used to rejoin Spock's katra with his physical body. Mind melds can also allow more than one mind to experience memories and sensations, and sometimes even interact with the memories.

293,Altered Carbon,2002,"Cortical Stacks serve as a receptacle for the human consciousness or Digital Human Freight (D.H.F.). All citizens within the Protectorate have a cortical stack implanted when they are one year old. Cortical Stacks are composed of a non-terrestrial metal left by an Alien civilization, along with astrogation charts mapping several habitable planets within the galaxy. Cortical Stacks were originally developed as a means of interstellar travel to reach these planets. By downloading the human consciousness, they were able to transmit it to a waiting body or ""Sleeve"" on a distant planet. This method of transmitting consciousness off-world, called Needlecasting, allowed instant travel to anywhere in the Settled Worlds that otherwise would take centuries to reach by traditional means.
Over time, this technology would become a method of immortality for those who could afford it. Placing the dead in new bodies, called ""Re-sleeving"", can be accomplished by simply downloading consciousness in a new Sleeve after death as long as the Cortical Stack is intact after sleeve-death. Citizens who cannot afford re-sleeving or do not want to be re-sleeved, have their Cortical Stacks placed in a storage facility after sleeve-death, where they can remain indefinitely.
Because of the nominal ability to revive anyone who dies, sleeve-death, so long as the cortical stack remained intact, was reduced to a lower level of legal concern, akin to property damage. Only if the stack was destroyed was such considered death or, if the result of violence, murder. It became common practice for the state to guarantee re-sleeving for victims of accidents or crimes, should they not specify their objection to being re-sleeved, although this re-sleeving was often done using whatever sleeves were available, regardless of quality or appropriateness, unless the individual had made other, usually extremely expensive, prior arrangements.
Care must be taken to avoid real death, as anything from blunt trauma to energy weapons fired at the stack (known as slagging) can destroy the stack.",implant,"consciousness transfer, storage","Novel, TV Series",consciousness,2002,2121,120,0.16666667,0.1183432,0.11109088,0.5,0.75,Richard K.

In less than a minute, the Teacher transferred vast amounts of knowledge to the user, but unfortunately this knowledge did not last. According to the Eymorg Kara the knowledge persisted for about three hours.
The Teacher's feeder circuits were optimized for the configurations of an Eymorg brain. When Dr. McCoy used the device in 2268, he experienced great pain. Spock initially warned him against using the device, concerned about the possibility of brain damage, but McCoy felt he had no choice as there was no other chance of restoring Spock's brain to his body before the body failed.

323,Men in Black,1997,"An electro bio-mechanical neural transmitting zero synapse repositioner, commonly referred to as a Neuralyzer is a top secret device used by the MiB. It has the ability to wipe the mind of anybody who sees the flash via isolating and editing certain electronic impulses related to memory. Once people are neuralyzed, they seem to enter a trance, freeze and their eyes lose focus. Once victims are neuralyzed, the agents must make up a story to replace the victims' erased memories and pass it off as truth. Neuralyzers are paramount to the MIB's operation and maintenance of secrecy.
A neuralyzer is a device varying in size, that wipes the memory of a target. The set length of memory erased can be changed using dials, and the effects can be reversed. In order for agents to not be harmed by the effects, they have ""Ray-Ban"" sunglasses, that deflect the light created by the neuralyzer. It is the standard equipment of MIB officers. After being neuralyzed, if the agent does not supply the new memory, or a group of people get neuralyzed, a special team is sent in to give memories, and change the environment to reflect these memories.

The mushroom is not only able to create a simulated reality for its users, it also apparently scans their minds for information. The idea of the horror video game the mushroom is used for is that it plumbs the user’s mind to find out what they fear, and then uses those fears to make the game scarier.
